# 📌 Your_BookMark

Your_BookMark is a Flask-based web application designed to help students and developers
**bookmark, organize, and revise questions efficiently** instead of repeatedly forgetting
previously solved problems.

## 🚀 Why Your_BookMark?

Many learners solve DSA problems regularly, but after a few weeks, the same problems feel new.
This happens because we often don’t track:
- what mistake we made
- what key idea helped solve the problem

Your_BookMark focuses on **structured revision**, not just problem solving.
